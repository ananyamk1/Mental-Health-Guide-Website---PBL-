# Mental-Health-Guide
Minor Project (PBL) - Semester 5

This project works on a noticed gap in mental health services and resources, leading us to create an e-platform to offer treatment alternatives for the early detection, prediction, and prevention of mental illnesses. This platform aims to be accessible even in rural and remote areas, at reduced costs and with greater flexibility. Our goal is to provide access to mental health information, tools, and healthcare through an online tool, expanding the reach of these resources to those who may not have access otherwise. This project aims at building an online tool for ensuring the reach of mental health information, tools, and healthcare services in view of expanding and touching those who lack these resources. 
A review of existing literature shows a heightening interest in the delivery of technology-based healthcare interventions over the last decade. These trends show that focus is gradually ascending from computer-based to internet-based and finally to mobile-based interventions as technology permeates more into our lives and becomes affordable. Mobile-based solutions have the potential to reduce the burden of health systems, empower patients and break barriers to help-seeking utilization of these digital resources in the field of healthcare in general and mental healthcare in particular. Literature shows only a handful of projects that deliver mobile-based services for health information, HIV, diabetes, tuberculosis, and cardiovascular diseases in India, but only two SMS services for mental health issues.
